Please fill in answers to the questions below:


1. What's your name?
Cristian Stransky



2. What's the URL of the github repo with your work for this HW?
https://github.com/csstransky/CS4550-Web-Development/tree/master/HW04



3. What's the URL that you deployed to?
hw04.cstransky.me



4. Is your game functionality complete? If not, what's missing?
My timeout doesn't have any locks, so when you press two tiles that aren't the
same, they'll stay there for half a second, and then dissappear, BUT you can
press other tiles in the mean time, and even screw up the logic if you move
too fast.

NOTE: If the delay seems fast, it's because I made it fast to try and avoid the
user getting ahead of the game logic because I didn't set up any locks

NOTE: I'm not sure it's specified in the actual assigment, but the score 
doesn't increase when you get two boxes correct, it only adds to your score
when you get the boxes wrong. Example: A perfect game is a score of 0, screwing
up two boxes adds 1 point.

NOTE: I wish I could've made it more attractive, but I didn't have time to play
with the CSS file.


5. Is your game properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?
It's deployed correctly.
