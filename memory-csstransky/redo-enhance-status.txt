Redo a previous assignment.

If redo, what did you fix?
It's properly deployed, and the game has correct flipping-back behaviors where
two unmatched tiles will wait for nearly a second, ignore all inputs in the
meantime, and then swap back to hidden tiles.

Also, code has been correctly indented.


If enhance, what enhancements did you make? Use at least a couple paragraphs to
describe your goals and how you did at meeting them.



If enhance, where (what URL) is your enhanced project deployed? Where's the git repo?
